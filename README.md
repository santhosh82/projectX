Have you ever used excel or any other software to manage the jobs you apply from various job portals?

This application  **Job Tracker** helps to solve this problem.

The app/website is live [here](https://sanbog.pythonanywhere.com/jobtracker/welcome) 

## Software Needed
- Python Version 3.5


## Installation 
-Initially you need to clone/download the repository.

-It would be better for you to manage if you use virtualenv.

- Run the following commands from terminal/command line
       pip install Django==1.9
       
       pip install django-extensions
       

-Then look in the projectx folder to find the file manage.py.

-Now to run the application, run the command 'python manage.py runserver' from terminal/command line.

-Once you execute the command, navigate to the [url](http://localhost:8000/jobtracker/welcome/) to see a welcome page which shows a sign up and sign in page.


## Usage 
-Once you are able to get the welcome page, sign up for the application.

-Use the same credentials to login and add the job details.

-I think the UI helps you to understand the flow.
